I am a doctoral student in Applied Mathematics at IPP-ENSAE-CREST, under the joint supervision of Prof. Peter Tankov (ENSAE) and Prof. René Aid (PSL Dauphine).

I focus on the intersection of mathematics and economics. Specifically, I am interested in the applications of stochastic optimal control theory and partial information tools to approach macroeconomic problems related to climate change and climate policies.

 I conduct my research at [CREST](https://crest.science), and I also collaborate on the project *Modélisation des Incitations et des Régulations pour la Transition Environnementale* [MIRTE](https://www.maths-vives.fr). 

I hold a bachelor's degree in Political Science and a master's degree in economics. I was also an *Allievo* at Collegio Carlo Alberto.
